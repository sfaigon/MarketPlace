<h1>An Nguyen SEI-Project 2-Marketplace</h1>
<h2>Web Description - Marketplace</h2>

<p>This a Marketplace webpage where users can look at stores and the items that they are selling. If a user is logged in with their google account, they can create their very own marketplace and list items to sell in any store that is available. They can also leaves reviews on their own store or another store. Users can also buy items that they want from any store. Once an item runs out of stock, it will no longer be available and then deleted.</p>

<p>This is the first screen that appears when you open the webpage. Without logging in you are restricted from creating your own marketplace but  you can still see the markets that are available.</p>

<p>Once you enter a store, the store details, reviews, and listings are displayed. Users are this point cannot interact and create any listings, make reviews, or buy items. If a user trys to buy one, they will be prompted to log in and the redirected to the home page.</p>

<p>With the user logged in, the home page is very similiar when the user is not logged in besides the new nav link to create a marketplace.</p>

<p>The user then can create their very own marketplace and decide on the name, location, and category of items to be sold. Upon creation, the user will be redirected to the markets page</p>

<p>Once the user decides to enter a market place. They are not allowed the option to leave reviews on the stores and create their very own listings. If they have any previous listings and reviews, they can update and edit them. Users can now also "purchase" items from the store. Once all itesm are purchased, the listing will be deleted.</p>

<h2>Some Code Snippets</h2>

<p>This is the logic behind the buy one method, simply reduce quantity by one and delete the listing itself once it runs out</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Something that this project could use would be more css and styling and possibly a way to keep tract of what items users have bought in manner that the listings users could see who owns them how much money.</p>
